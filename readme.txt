Contributors: Timo Schlueter
Tags: meta, description, tags
Requires at least: 2.7.0
Tested up to: 2.7.1
Stable tag: 1.1

== Description ==

TagMeta generates meta keywords using your most used tags.
It automatically gets the 10 most used tags out of your
blog posts and pages and puts them into a valid meta-
keyword string. This string then appears in the header of
the home page of your theme. If you want to add tags per
post, i suggest youre going to use the Headspace plugin.

== Installation ==

You dont have to set any options in the admin panel. 
Just install the plugin and activate it.
